          Hey, My name is Vipul. I published my first computer program at the
          age of 16 and two years later, after an intensive studies in math,
          physics and chemistry, I was ranked amongst the highest candidates in
          the academic examination conducted by Joint Admission Board, JEE
          Advanced. I graduated from Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy. I
          was selected for Internship program at Amazon. were I worked on to
          enhancing my technical skills in the areas of Artificial Intelligence
          and Web technologies. After Graduation, I refused to follow the
          traditional career path and started working on solving and finding
          better problems to challenge and put my skills to use.
